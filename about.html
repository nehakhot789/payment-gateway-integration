THE PROBLEM
There are a lot of people whose livelihood is affected by the COVID19 pandemic. A lot of people have lost their jobs, especially from the weaker sections of society such as housemaids, house servants, construction workers, etc. These people mostly reside in slums and now they have not enough money left to even get the meals for their family.
We have interacted with those families and their kids. They need help in getting jobs and until they have their jobs, they have to sleep hungry. So have decided to provide meals to those families so that they can at least survive through these tough times of pandemic
OUR SOLUTION
To help these families survive through these tough times, we have decided to provide them cooked food and some ration for those families.
THE IMPACT
This food donation drive is providing support to the families affected by COVID19. Those people are getting motivated again to find new jobs and this drive is helping them to adjust to the current situation.
